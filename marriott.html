    <h1 class="mb-1">Marriott Homes & Villas Website Redesign</h1>
    <p class="subtitle mb-4">Global Career Accelerator + Publicis Sapient | August 2024</p>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>This project was part of a web development and prototyping case study in partnership with Publicis Sapient. The challenge was to redesign Marriott's Homes & Villas booking site to improve the user experience, accessibility, and feature prioritization for travelers booking vacation rentals.</p>

    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>UX/UI Designer</li>
      <li>Researcher</li>
      <li>Front-End Developer</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>The original Homes & Villas experience lacked personalization and clarity in navigation, especially when users were filtering listings or comparing properties. The site also lacked consistent accessibility standards and visual hierarchy in key decision-making flows.</p>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Analyzed qualitative user interviews and quantitative surveys to identify common frustrations with the booking process</li>
      <li>Reviewed competitive platforms such as Airbnb and VRBO for usability insights and feature benchmarking</li>
      <li>Mapped key user journeys (e.g., search → compare → book) to uncover friction points</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Insights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Users want a simplified filtering experience and visual cues that help distinguish listings quickly</li>
      <li>Accessibility and mobile responsiveness were inconsistent across devices</li>
      <li>Users valued transparency in pricing and amenities more than flashy visuals</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Design & Prototyping</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Created a high-fidelity prototype using Figma, featuring simplified navigation, improved listing cards, and clearer CTAs</li>
      <li>Designed components for a custom design system (buttons, inputs, filters, listing tiles)</li>
      <li>Prioritized accessibility with consistent spacing, contrast, and readable typography</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Development</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Built the redesigned homepage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
      <li>Implemented responsive layout with semantic HTML and Bootstrap</li>
      <li>Ensured the structure met accessibility standards and passed visual contrast checks</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Prototype</h2>

    <p>The final prototype included an intuitive filtering sidebar, bold CTA buttons, and clear visual indicators for property features and booking steps.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>This project helped me bridge the gap between research, prototyping, and front-end development. It strengthened my ability to align business goals with user needs, and to move from insights to implementation in a structured, accessible design process.</p>
