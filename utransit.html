    <h1 class="mb-1">UTransit: UX Research & Product Design</h1>
    <p class="subtitle mb-4">User Experience Design | February–May 2024</p>

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>UTransit is a mobile app concept created to promote public transit usage among University of Texas at Austin students. Our goal was to design a digital solution that makes riding the bus more intuitive, accessible, and appealing to college students who often default to driving or rideshares.</p>

    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Team Lead</li>
      <li>UX Researcher & Designer</li>
      <li>Wireframing & Mockup Development</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Students at UT Austin often overlook public transit as a reliable commuting option. Many perceive it as inconvenient or confusing to use, especially when compared to faster (but more expensive and less sustainable) alternatives like rideshare apps or personal cars.</p>

    <h2>Research</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Conducted user interviews to understand commuting pain points</li>
      <li>Performed a competitive analysis of popular transit and navigation apps</li>
      <li>Created journey maps and personas based on insights from students</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Insights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Students prioritize convenience and clarity in their commuting tools</li>
      <li>Real-time tracking and simplified route planning were frequently requested</li>
      <li>Many students avoid transit due to past confusion or negative experiences</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Mapped user flows and key scenarios (e.g., finding routes, locating stops)</li>
      <li>Designed wireframes and mockups using Canva and Figma-style layout tools</li>
      <li>Incorporated intuitive icons, color coding, and call-to-actions for navigation</li>
      <li>Prioritized accessibility through contrast, text hierarchy, and tap targets</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Mockup</h2>

    <p>Our final design features an interactive, student-friendly interface for real-time bus tracking, personalized route suggestions, and quick access to campus-specific information.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>This project taught me how to translate research insights into concrete design decisions. It deepened my understanding of how environmental goals can be paired with user-centered thinking to create meaningful behavior change. It also reinforced my leadership skills as I helped guide my team through the entire UX process.</p>
